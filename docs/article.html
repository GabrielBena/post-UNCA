<h2 id='introduction'><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Cellular Automata (CA) represent a fascinating class of computational models that have captivated researchers across disciplines for their ability to produce complex behaviors from simple rules <d-cite key="computational_beauty"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>At their core, CA typically consist of a grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, which evolve over discrete time steps based on a fixed deterministic rule.</p>
<p>This rule, applied uniformly to all cells, governs the state transition of each cell based solely on its current state and those of its neighbors.</p>
<p>Despite their simplicity, CA have become a cornerstone in studying emergence and complexity <d-cite key="wolfram_cellular_1984"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>Mathematical proofs have established that well-known CA, such as Conway&#39;s Game of Life, Elementary Cellular Automata, and Wireworld, are capable of universal computation, underscoring their remarkable power and expressiveness <d-cite key="cook"></d-cite>, <d-cite key="life_turing_2016"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>Beyond these formal demonstrations, researchers have constructed fully functional Turing machines within these CA, albeit through arduous efforts requiring meticulous design and substantial time investment.</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of continuous CA has enabled to bridge the gap between the discrete nature of traditional models like Conway&#39;s Game of Life and the analog characteristics of the real world.</p>
<p>Notable examples include Lenia <d-cite key="lenia"></d-cite> and SmoothLife <d-cite key="smoothlife"></d-cite>, which extend classic CA to simulate lifelike patterns with continuous dynamics.</p>
<p>However, a key open question persists: are these models capable of universal computation? While the answer is likely affirmative, given their expressive potential, proving this remains elusive.</p>
<p>The lack of discrete states and well-defined transitions makes it harder to encode symbolic information reliably — slight perturbations can lead to significant divergence over time, undermining the stability required for computation. Moreover, in contrast to the sharp boundaries and interactions of traditional CA, continuous models often exhibit smooth, fuzzy dynamics that make it challenging to design modular components like wires, gates, or memory elements with predictable behavior.</p>
<p>What was already a laborious task in discrete CA becomes more difficult, if not practically impossible, in the continuous domain, highlighting a fundamental challenge in building efficient analog computers.</p>
<p>In parallel with these developments, Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a compelling paradigm that blends the local, decentralized dynamics of classical CA with the representational capacity and trainability of neural networks <d-cite key="nca"></d-cite>.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional CA, where the update rule is explicitly handcrafted, NCA leverage differentiable architectures wherein the rule is parameterized by a neural network and optimized end-to-end via gradient descent. This makes it possible to <i>learn</i> complex behaviors and dynamics from data, bypassing the need for manual rule design.</p>
<p>Recent work has demonstrated that NCA can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks: from self-organizing into complex morphologies <d-cite key="nca"></d-cite>, to solving algorithmic reasoning tasks such as instances of the 1D-ARC challenge <d-cite key="cax"></d-cite>, exhibiting emergent collective behaviors <d-cite key="self_classifying"></d-cite>, and growing artificial neural networks <d-cite key="hypernca"></d-cite>. These results highlight the versatility of NCA as a model of computation and pattern formation.</p>
<p>Given the Turing completeness of classical CA, NCA offer an exciting new lens through which to explore the space of rules — not by manually engineering them, but by searching for them through optimization. In essence, NCA turn rule discovery into a machine learning problem.</p>
<p>This shift is significant: the traditionally arduous task of hand-crafting rule sets that give rise to desired behaviors is now offloaded to the learning algorithm itself. Backpropagation through time, combined with the differentiable nature of NCA, allows for flexible, automated tuning of highly non-trivial dynamics.</p>
<p>In this work, we explore the potential of the Neural Cellular Automata paradigm to pioneer the development of a continuous Universal Cellular Automata <d-cite key="universal_ca"></d-cite>, with the ambitious goal of inducing a universal Turing machine <d-cite key="universal_turing_machine"></d-cite> to emerge within a continuous CA through training via gradient descent.</p>
<p>The development of Universal Neural Cellular Automata has implications beyond academic curiosity or creating interesting simulations. It touches on fundamental questions about the potential for continuous dynamic systems to exhibit universal computation, or the possibility to create a universal analog computer.</p>
<p>This paper establishes the foundational framework and presents promising initial steps toward realizing this grand vision.</p>
<p>First, we propose a novel framework that disentangles the concepts of &quot;hardware&quot; and &quot;state&quot; within NCA. In this abstraction, CA rules serve as the &quot;physics&quot; dictating state transitions across space and time, akin to the fundamental laws governing computation. The CA state, in turn, acts as the dynamic physical substrate — comparable to electrical charges in a computer or neurochemical patterns in a brain—while the &quot;hardware&quot; represents an immutable scaffold, fixed in its spatial configuration throughout a simulation. This hardware can be leveraged by the physics (i.e., the CA rules) to guide computation but remains unalterable during runtime, providing a stable backbone for emergent behaviors.</p>
<p>Second, we introduce preliminary objective functions and training setups designed to steer NCA toward universal computation in a continuous domain.</p>
<p>Third, we conduct experiments demonstrating the training of essential computational building blocks — such as matrix multiplication, dot-product and transposition — within the NCA framework.</p>
<p>Finally, we showcase the practical utility of these building blocks by emulating a neural network directly within the mutable CA state, successfully solving the MNIST digit classification task.</p>
<p>These results mark a critical first step, illustrating how NCA can harness gradient descent to sculpt continuous CA into powerful, general-purpose computational systems.</p>
